# MODX Compatibility Tester

This is a tool that will check your installed extras for compatibility with future releases of MODX.

This is useful for installing on a 2.x site to see if your extras are compatible with 3.x.

Disclaimer: This checks based on the data filled out by the extras submitters. Some submitters may not have filled out the compatibility information correctly. This is a tool to help you, not a guarantee.
